# Specification Proposal Creation

Creates comprehensive change proposals following spec-driven development methodology.

## Quick Start

Creating a spec proposal involves three main outputs:
1. **proposal.md** - Why, what, and impact summary
2. **tasks.md** - Numbered implementation checklist
3. **spec-delta.md** - Formal requirement changes (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED)

**Basic workflow**: Generate change ID → scaffold directories → draft proposal → create spec deltas → validate structure

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Proposal Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Review existing specifications
- [ ] Step 2: Generate unique change ID
- [ ] Step 3: Scaffold directory structure
- [ ] Step 4: Draft proposal.md (Why/What/Impact)
- [ ] Step 5: Create tasks.md implementation checklist
- [ ] Step 6: Write spec deltas with EARS format
- [ ] Step 7: Validate proposal structure
- [ ] Step 8: Present for user approval
```

### Step 1: Review existing specifications

Before creating a proposal, understand the current state:

```bash
# List all existing specs
find spec/specs -name "spec.md" -type f

# List active changes to avoid conflicts
find spec/changes -maxdepth 1 -type d -not -path "*/archive"

# Search for related requirements
grep -r "### Requirement:" spec/specs/
```

### Step 2: Generate unique change ID

Choose a descriptive, URL-safe identifier:

**Format**: `add-<feature>`, `fix-<issue>`, `update-<component>`, `remove-<feature>`

**Examples**:
- `add-user-authentication`
- `fix-payment-validation`
- `update-api-rate-limits`
- `remove-legacy-endpoints`

**Validation**: Check for conflicts:
```bash
ls spec/changes/ | grep -i "<proposed-id>"
```

### Step 3: Scaffold directory structure

Create the change folder with standard structure:

```bash
# Replace {change-id} with actual ID
mkdir -p spec/changes/{change-id}/specs/{capability-name}
```

**Example**:
```bash
mkdir -p spec/changes/add-user-auth/specs/authentication
```

### Step 4: Draft proposal.md

Use the template at [templates/proposal.md](templates/proposal.md) as starting point.

**Required sections**:
- **Why**: Problem or opportunity driving this change
- **What Changes**: Bullet list of modifications
- **Impact**: Affected specs, code, APIs, users

**Tone**: Clear, concise, decision-focused. Avoid unnecessary background.

### Step 5: Create tasks.md implementation checklist

Break implementation into concrete, testable tasks. Use the template at [templates/tasks.md](templates/tasks.md).

**Format**:
```markdown
# Implementation Tasks

1. [First concrete task]
2. [Second concrete task]
3. [Test task]
4. [Documentation task]
```

**Best practices**:
- Each task is independently completable
- Include testing and validation tasks
- Order by dependencies (database before API, etc.)
- 5-15 tasks is typical; split if more needed

### Step 6: Write spec deltas with EARS format

This is the most critical step. Spec deltas use **EARS format** (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax).

**For complete EARS guidelines**, see [reference/EARS_FORMAT.md](reference/EARS_FORMAT.md)

**Delta operations**:
- `## ADDED Requirements` - New capabilities
- `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changed behavior (include full updated text)
- `## REMOVED Requirements` - Deprecated features

**Basic requirement structure**:
```markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: User Login
WHEN a user submits valid credentials,
the system SHALL authenticate the user and create a session.

#### Scenario: Successful Login
GIVEN a user with email "user@example.com" and password "correct123"
WHEN the user submits the login form
THEN the system creates an authenticated session
AND redirects to the dashboard
```

**For validation patterns**, see [reference/VALIDATION_PATTERNS.md](reference/VALIDATION_PATTERNS.md)

### Step 7: Validate proposal structure

Run these checks before presenting to user:

```markdown
Structure Checklist:
- [ ] Directory exists: `spec/changes/{change-id}/`
- [ ] proposal.md has Why/What/Impact sections
- [ ] tasks.md has numbered task list (5-15 items)
- [ ] Spec deltas have operation headers (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED)
- [ ] Requirements follow `### Requirement: <name>` format
- [ ] Scenarios use `#### Scenario:` format (4 hashtags)
```

**Automated checks**:
```bash
# Count delta operations (should be > 0)
grep -c "## ADDED\|MODIFIED\|REMOVED" spec/changes/{change-id}/specs/**/*.md

# Verify scenario format (should show line numbers)
grep -n "#### Scenario:" spec/changes/{change-id}/specs/**/*.md

# Check requirement headers
grep -n "### Requirement:" spec/changes/{change-id}/specs/**/*.md
```

### Step 8: Present for user approval

Summarize the proposal clearly:

```markdown
## Proposal Summary

**Change ID**: {change-id}
**Scope**: {brief description}

**Files created**:
- spec/changes/{change-id}/proposal.md
- spec/changes/{change-id}/tasks.md
- spec/changes/{change-id}/specs/{capability}/spec-delta.md

**Next steps**:
Review the proposal. If approved, say "implement it" or "apply the change" to begin implementation.
```

## Advanced Topics

**EARS format details**: See [reference/EARS_FORMAT.md](reference/EARS_FORMAT.md)
**Validation patterns**: See [reference/VALIDATION_PATTERNS.md](reference/VALIDATION_PATTERNS.md)
**Complete examples**: See [reference/EXAMPLES.md](reference/EXAMPLES.md)

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: New feature proposal

When adding net-new capability:
- Use `ADDED Requirements` delta
- Include positive scenarios AND error handling
- Consider edge cases in scenarios

### Pattern 2: Breaking change proposal

When changing existing behavior:
- Use `MODIFIED Requirements` delta
- Include complete updated requirement text
- Document what changes and why in proposal.md
- Consider migration tasks in tasks.md

### Pattern 3: Deprecation proposal

When removing features:
- Use `REMOVED Requirements` delta
- Document removal rationale in proposal.md
- Include cleanup tasks in tasks.md
- Consider user migration in impact section

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't**:
- Skip validation checks (always run grep patterns)
- Create proposals without reviewing existing specs first
- Use vague task descriptions ("Fix the thing")
- Write requirements without scenarios
- Forget error handling scenarios
- Mix multiple unrelated changes in one proposal

**Do**:
- Check for conflicts before creating change ID
- Write concrete, testable tasks
- Include positive AND negative scenarios
- Keep one concern per proposal
- Validate structure before presenting

## File Templates

All templates are in the `templates/` directory:
- [proposal.md](templates/proposal.md) - Proposal structure
- [tasks.md](templates/tasks.md) - Task checklist format
- [spec-delta.md](templates/spec-delta.md) - Spec delta template

- [VALIDATION_PATTERNS.md](reference/VALIDATION_PATTERNS.md) - Grep/bash validation
- [EXAMPLES.md](reference/EXAMPLES.md) - Real-world proposal examples
