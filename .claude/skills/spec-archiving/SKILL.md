# Specification Archiving

Archives completed change proposals and merges their spec deltas into the living specification documentation.

## Quick Start

Archiving involves two main operations:
1. **Move change folder** to archive with timestamp
2. **Merge spec deltas** into living specs (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED operations)

**Critical rule**: Verify all tasks are complete before archiving. Archiving signifies deployment and completion.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Archive Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Verify implementation is complete
- [ ] Step 2: Review spec deltas to merge
- [ ] Step 3: Create timestamped archive directory
- [ ] Step 4: Merge ADDED requirements into living specs
- [ ] Step 5: Merge MODIFIED requirements into living specs
- [ ] Step 6: Merge REMOVED requirements into living specs
- [ ] Step 7: Move change folder to archive
- [ ] Step 8: Validate living spec structure
```

### Step 1: Verify implementation is complete

Before archiving, confirm all work is done:

```bash
# Check for IMPLEMENTED marker
test -f spec/changes/{change-id}/IMPLEMENTED && echo "✓ Implemented" || echo "✗ Not implemented"

# Review tasks
cat spec/changes/{change-id}/tasks.md

# Check git status for uncommitted work
git status
```

**Ask the user**:
```markdown
Are all tasks complete and tested?
Has this change been deployed to production?
Should I proceed with archiving?
```

### Step 2: Review spec deltas to merge

Understand what will be merged:

```bash
# List all spec delta files
find spec/changes/{change-id}/specs -name "*.md" -type f

# Read each delta
for file in spec/changes/{change-id}/specs/**/*.md; do
    echo "=== $file ==="
    cat "$file"
done
```

**Identify**:
- Which capabilities are affected
- How many requirements are ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED
- Where in living specs these changes belong

### Step 3: Create timestamped archive directory

```bash
# Create archive with today's date
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
mkdir -p spec/archive/${TIMESTAMP}-{change-id}
```

**Example**:
```bash
# For change "add-user-auth" archived on Oct 26, 2025
mkdir -p spec/archive/2025-10-26-add-user-auth
```

### Step 4: Merge ADDED requirements into living specs

For each `## ADDED Requirements` section:

**Process**:
1. Locate the target living spec file
2. Append the new requirements to the end of the file
3. Maintain proper markdown formatting

**Example**:

**Source** (`spec/changes/add-user-auth/specs/authentication/spec-delta.md`):
```markdown
## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: User Login
WHEN a user submits valid credentials,
the system SHALL authenticate the user and create a session.

#### Scenario: Successful Login
GIVEN valid credentials
WHEN user submits login form
THEN system creates session
```

**Target** (`spec/specs/authentication/spec.md`):
```bash
# Append to living spec
cat >> spec/specs/authentication/spec.md << 'EOF'

### Requirement: User Login
WHEN a user submits valid credentials,
the system SHALL authenticate the user and create a session.

#### Scenario: Successful Login
GIVEN valid credentials
WHEN user submits login form
THEN system creates session
EOF
```

### Step 5: Merge MODIFIED requirements into living specs

For each `## MODIFIED Requirements` section:

**Process**:
1. Locate the existing requirement in the living spec
2. Replace the ENTIRE requirement block (including all scenarios)
3. Use the complete updated text from the delta

**Example using sed**:

```bash
# Find and replace requirement block
# This is conceptual - actual implementation depends on structure

# First, identify the line range of the old requirement
START_LINE=$(grep -n "### Requirement: User Login" spec/specs/authentication/spec.md | cut -d: -f1)

# Find the end (next requirement or end of file)
END_LINE=$(tail -n +$((START_LINE + 1)) spec/specs/authentication/spec.md | \
           grep -n "^### Requirement:" | head -1 | cut -d: -f1)

# Delete old requirement
sed -i "${START_LINE},${END_LINE}d" spec/specs/authentication/spec.md

# Insert new requirement at same position
# (Extract from delta and insert)
```

**Manual approach** (recommended for safety):
```markdown
1. Open living spec in editor
2. Find the requirement by name
3. Delete entire block (requirement + all scenarios)
4. Paste updated requirement from delta
5. Save
```

### Step 6: Merge REMOVED requirements into living specs

For each `## REMOVED Requirements` section:

**Process**:
1. Locate the requirement in the living spec
2. Delete the entire requirement block
3. Add a comment documenting the removal

**Example**:

```bash
# Option 1: Delete with comment
# Manually edit spec/specs/authentication/spec.md

# Add deprecation comment
echo "<!-- Requirement 'Legacy Password Reset' removed $(date +%Y-%m-%d) -->" >> spec/specs/authentication/spec.md

# Delete the requirement block manually or with sed
```

**Pattern**:
```markdown
<!-- Removed 2025-10-26: User must use email-based password reset -->
~~### Requirement: SMS Password Reset~~
```

### Step 7: Move change folder to archive

After all deltas are merged:

```bash
# Move entire change folder to archive
mv spec/changes/{change-id} spec/archive/${TIMESTAMP}-{change-id}
```

**Verify move succeeded**:
```bash
# Check archive exists
ls -la spec/archive/${TIMESTAMP}-{change-id}

# Check changes directory is clean
ls spec/changes/ | grep "{change-id}"  # Should return nothing
```

### Step 8: Validate living spec structure

After merging, validate the living specs are well-formed:

```bash
# Check requirement format
grep -n "### Requirement:" spec/specs/**/*.md

# Check scenario format
grep -n "#### Scenario:" spec/specs/**/*.md

# Count requirements per spec
for spec in spec/specs/**/spec.md; do
    count=$(grep -c "### Requirement:" "$spec")
    echo "$spec: $count requirements"
done
```

**Manual review**:
- Open each modified spec file
- Verify markdown formatting is correct
- Check requirements flow logically
- Ensure no duplicate requirements exist

## Merge Logic Reference

### ADDED Operation

```
Action: Append to living spec
Location: End of file (before any footer/appendix)
Format: Copy requirement + all scenarios exactly as written
```

### MODIFIED Operation

```
Action: Replace existing requirement
Location: Find by requirement name, replace entire block
Format: Use complete updated text from delta (don't merge, replace)
Note: Old version is preserved in archive
```

### REMOVED Operation

```
Action: Delete requirement, add deprecation comment
Location: Find by requirement name
Format: Delete entire block, optionally add <!-- Removed YYYY-MM-DD: reason -->
```

### RENAMED Operation (uncommon)

```
Action: Update requirement name, keep content
Location: Find by old name, update to new name
Format: Just change the header: ### Requirement: NewName
Note: Typically use MODIFIED instead
```

## Best Practices

### Pattern 1: Verify Before Moving

**Always** verify delta merges before moving to archive:

```bash
# After merging, check diff
git diff spec/specs/

# Review changes
git diff spec/specs/authentication/spec.md

# If correct, commit
git add spec/specs/
git commit -m "Merge spec deltas from add-user-auth"

# Then archive
mv spec/changes/add-user-auth spec/archive/2025-10-26-add-user-auth
```

### Pattern 2: Atomic Archiving

Archive entire changes, not individual files:

**Good**:
```bash
# Move complete change folder
mv spec/changes/add-user-auth spec/archive/2025-10-26-add-user-auth
```

**Bad**:
```bash
# Don't cherry-pick files
mv spec/changes/add-user-auth/proposal.md spec/archive/
# (leaves orphaned files)
```

### Pattern 3: Archive Preservation

The archive is a historical record. Never modify archived files:

```markdown
❌ Don't: Edit files in spec/archive/
✓ Do: Treat archive as read-only history
```

### Pattern 4: Git Commit Strategy

Recommended commit workflow:

```bash
# Commit 1: Merge deltas
git add spec/specs/
git commit -m "Merge spec deltas from add-user-auth

- Added User Login requirement
- Modified Password Policy requirement
- Removed Legacy Auth requirement"

# Commit 2: Archive change
git add spec/archive/ spec/changes/
git commit -m "Archive add-user-auth change"
```

## Advanced Topics

**For complex deltas**: See [reference/MERGE_LOGIC.md](reference/MERGE_LOGIC.md)

**Conflict resolution**: If multiple changes modified the same requirement, manual merge is required.

**Rollback strategy**: To rollback an archive, reverse the process (move from archive back to changes, remove merged content from living specs).

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Addition

```markdown
Change adds 1 new requirement → Append to spec → Archive
```

### Pattern 2: Behavioral Change

```markdown
Change modifies 1 requirement → Replace in spec → Archive
```

### Pattern 3: Deprecation

```markdown
Change removes 1 requirement → Delete from spec with comment → Archive
```

### Pattern 4: Feature with Multiple Requirements

```markdown
Change adds 5 requirements across 2 specs
→ Append each to respective spec
→ Verify all are merged
→ Archive
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't**:
- Archive incomplete implementations
- Merge deltas before deployment
- Modify archived files
- Skip validation after merging
- Forget to git commit merged specs

**Do**:
- Verify all tasks complete before archiving
- Merge deltas carefully and completely
- Treat archive as immutable history
- Validate merged specs structure
- Commit merged specs before archiving move

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Merge conflict (requirement exists in living spec)

**Solution**:
```markdown
1. If names match but content differs → Use MODIFIED pattern
2. If truly different requirements → Rename one
3. If duplicate by mistake → Use whichever is correct
```

### Issue: Can't find requirement to modify/remove

**Solution**:
```markdown
1. Search by partial name: grep -i "login" spec/specs/**/*.md
2. Check if already removed
3. Check if in different capability file
```

### Issue: Living spec has formatting errors after merge

**Solution**:
```markdown
1. Fix formatting manually
2. Re-run validation: grep -n "###" spec/specs/**/*.md
3. Ensure consistent heading levels
```
