# Specification Implementation

Systematically implements approved spec proposals by executing tasks sequentially with proper testing and validation.

## Quick Start

Implementation follows a read → execute → test → validate cycle for each task:
1. Read the full proposal and task list
2. Execute tasks one at a time, in order
3. Test each completed task
4. Mark complete only after verification

**Critical rule**: Use TodoWrite to track progress. Never skip tasks or mark incomplete work as done.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track progress:

```
Implementation Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Load and understand the proposal
- [ ] Step 2: Set up TodoWrite task tracking
- [ ] Step 3: Execute tasks sequentially
- [ ] Step 4: Test and validate each task
- [ ] Step 5: Update living specifications (if applicable)
- [ ] Step 6: Mark proposal as implementation-complete
```

### Step 1: Load and understand the proposal

Before starting, read all context:

```bash
# Read the proposal
cat spec/changes/{change-id}/proposal.md

# Read all tasks
cat spec/changes/{change-id}/tasks.md

# Read spec deltas to understand requirements
find spec/changes/{change-id}/specs -name "*.md" -exec cat {} \;
```

**Understand**:
- Why this change is needed (from proposal.md)
- What the expected outcomes are
- Which specs will be affected
- What the acceptance criteria are (from scenarios)

### Step 2: Set up TodoWrite task tracking

Load tasks from tasks.md into TodoWrite **before starting work**:

```markdown
**Pattern**:
Read tasks.md → Extract numbered list → Create TodoWrite entries

**Example**:
If tasks.md contains:
1. Create database migration
2. Implement API endpoint
3. Add tests
4. Update documentation

Then create TodoWrite with:
- content: "Create database migration", status: "in_progress"
- content: "Implement API endpoint", status: "pending"
- content: "Add tests", status: "pending"
- content: "Update documentation", status: "pending"
```

**Why this matters**: TodoWrite gives the user visibility into progress and ensures nothing gets skipped.

### Step 3: Execute tasks sequentially

Work through tasks **one at a time, in order**:

```markdown
For each task:
1. Mark as "in_progress" in TodoWrite
2. Execute the work
3. Test the work
4. Only mark "completed" after verification

NEVER skip ahead or batch multiple tasks before testing.
```

**Task execution pattern**:

```markdown
## Task: {Task Description}

**What**: [Brief explanation of what this task does]

**Implementation**:
[Code changes, file edits, commands run]

**Verification**:
[How to verify this task is complete]
- [ ] Code compiles/runs
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Meets requirement scenarios

**Status**: ✓ Complete / ✗ Blocked / ⚠ Partial
```

### Step 4: Test and validate each task

After each task, verify it works:

**For code tasks**:
```bash
# Run relevant tests
npm test # or pytest, cargo test, etc.

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Check types (if applicable)
npm run type-check
```

**For database tasks**:
```bash
# Verify migration runs
npm run db:migrate

# Check schema matches expected
npm run db:schema
```

**For API tasks**:
```bash
# Test endpoint manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'

# Or run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

**Only mark task complete after all verifications pass**.

### Step 5: Update living specifications (if applicable)

**During implementation**, if you discover the spec deltas need updates:

1. **Document the discovery** in proposal.md or a notes file
2. **Do NOT modify spec deltas** during implementation
3. **After implementation completes**, consider whether spec needs adjustment

**Note**: Spec deltas are merged during archiving (Step 6), not during implementation.

### Step 6: Mark proposal as implementation-complete

After all tasks are complete:

```bash
# Create a completion marker
echo "Implementation completed: $(date)" > spec/changes/{change-id}/IMPLEMENTED
```

**Tell the user**:
```markdown
## Implementation Complete

**Change**: {change-id}
**Tasks completed**: {count}
**Tests**: All passing

**Next step**: Archive this change to merge spec deltas into living documentation.
Say "archive {change-id}" or "archive this change" when ready.
```

## Best Practices

### Pattern 1: Blocked Tasks

If a task cannot be completed:

```markdown
**Mark as blocked**:
- Keep status as "in_progress" (NOT "completed")
- Document the blocker clearly
- Create a new task for resolving the blocker
- Inform the user immediately

**Example**:
Task: "Implement payment processing"
Blocker: "Missing API credentials for payment gateway"
Action: Create new task "Obtain payment gateway credentials"
```

### Pattern 2: Task Dependencies

If tasks have dependencies, verify prerequisites before starting:

```bash
# Example: Database migration must run before API code
# Check migration status
npm run db:status

# Only proceed with API task if migration succeeded
```

### Pattern 3: Incremental Testing

Test incrementally, not at the end:

**Good**:
```
Task 1: Create model → Test model → Mark complete
Task 2: Create API → Test API → Mark complete
Task 3: Add validation → Test validation → Mark complete
```

**Bad**:
```
Task 1, 2, 3 → Implement all → Test everything → Debug failures
```

### Pattern 4: Living Documentation

Keep README, API docs, and comments up to date **as you go**:

```markdown
When adding a new API endpoint, also:
- Update API documentation
- Add example request/response
- Update OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- Add inline code comments
```

## Advanced Topics

**Parallel work**: If tasks are truly independent (e.g., separate modules), you can work on them in parallel, but each must be tested independently.

**Integration points**: When task dependencies exist, use integration tests to verify the connection works.

**Rollback strategy**: For risky changes, create rollback tasks before deploying.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Database + API + UI

Typical order:
1. Database schema/migration
2. Data access layer (models)
3. Business logic layer (services)
4. API endpoints (controllers)
5. UI integration
6. End-to-end tests

### Pattern 2: Feature Flags

For gradual rollouts:
1. Implement feature behind flag
2. Test with flag enabled
3. Deploy with flag disabled
4. Enable flag incrementally
5. Remove flag after full rollout

### Pattern 3: Breaking Changes

For API breaking changes:
1. Implement new version (v2)
2. Keep old version (v1) working
3. Add deprecation warnings to v1
4. Migrate users to v2
5. Remove v1 (separate task/proposal)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't**:
- Skip testing individual tasks
- Mark tasks complete before verification
- Ignore failing tests ("I'll fix it later")
- Batch multiple tasks before testing
- Modify living specs during implementation
- Work out of order (dependencies break)

**Do**:
- Test each task immediately
- Fix failing tests before proceeding
- Update TodoWrite in real-time
- Document blockers clearly
- Communicate progress to user
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests failing after task completion

**Solution**:
```markdown
1. Do NOT mark task complete
2. Debug the failure
3. Fix the code
4. Re-run tests
5. Only mark complete after pass
```

### Issue: Task is too large

**Solution**:
```markdown
1. Break into subtasks
2. Update TodoWrite with subtasks
3. Complete subtasks sequentially
4. Mark parent task complete after all subtasks done
```

### Issue: Dependency not met

**Solution**:
```markdown
1. Pause current task
2. Complete dependency first
3. Test dependency
4. Resume original task
```
