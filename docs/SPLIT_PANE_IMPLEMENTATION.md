# Split Pane Implementation - October 25, 2025

## Overview

Successfully implemented split pane functionality for Saternal terminal, enabling users to divide the terminal window into multiple independent shell sessions with keyboard-driven navigation and management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Pane Splitting
- **Horizontal splits** (top/bottom) via **Ctrl+D**
- Splits the currently focused pane (not root)
- New pane automatically gets focus
- 50/50 space allocation between split panes
- Each pane runs an independent shell session with separate PTY

### 2. Focus Navigation
- **Ctrl+Tab**: Move focus to next pane (circular)
- **Ctrl+Shift+Tab**: Move focus to previous pane (circular)
- Focused pane receives all keyboard input
- Visual distinction planned (border colors)

### 3. Pane Lifecycle
- **Ctrl+W**: Close focused pane
- Cannot close the last remaining pane (safety check)
- Tree automatically rebalances when pane is closed
- Focus moves to next available pane after close

## Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Ctrl+D** | Split Horizontal | Creates top/bottom split |
| **Ctrl+Tab** | Next Pane | Cycles focus forward |
| **Ctrl+Shift+Tab** | Previous Pane | Cycles focus backward |
| **Ctrl+W** | Close Pane | Closes focused pane (if not last) |

## Architecture Changes

### Core Components Modified

#### 1. **saternal-core/src/pane.rs**
Added new methods to `PaneNode`:
- `split_focused()` - Splits the currently focused pane instead of root
- `clear_focus()` - Helper to clear focus from all panes in subtree
- `focus_next()` - Circular forward navigation through panes
- `focus_prev()` - Circular backward navigation through panes
- `close_focused()` - Closes focused pane and rebalances tree

**Key Implementation Details:**
```rust
// Recursively finds and splits the focused pane
pub fn split_focused(
    &mut self,
    direction: SplitDirection,
    new_id: usize,
    shell: Option<String>,
) -> Result<bool>

// Circular navigation through flat list of pane IDs
pub fn focus_next(&mut self) -> bool
pub fn focus_prev(&mut self) -> bool

// Removes focused pane and collapses parent split
pub fn close_focused(&mut self) -> Result<bool>
```

#### 2. **saternal/src/tab.rs**
Updated `Tab` struct:
- Modified `split()` to use `split_focused()` instead of root split
- Added `close_focused_pane()` with safety check (won't close last pane)
- Focus automatically transfers to next pane after close

#### 3. **saternal/src/app.rs**
Added keyboard shortcut handlers:
- Ctrl+D → `tab.split(SplitDirection::Horizontal, shell)`
- Ctrl+Tab/Shift+Tab → `tab.pane_tree.focus_next()` / `focus_prev()`
- Ctrl+W → `tab.close_focused_pane()`
- Updated render path to use `render_with_panes(&tab.pane_tree)`

**Lifetime Fix:**
```rust
// Holds both locks during rendering to avoid dangling reference
if let (Some(mut renderer), Some(tab_mgr)) = 
    (renderer.try_lock(), tab_manager.try_lock()) 
{
    // Render while holding locks
    renderer.render_with_panes(&tab.pane_tree)?;
}
```

#### 4. **saternal-core/src/renderer/mod.rs**
New rendering infrastructure:
- `render_with_panes(&PaneNode)` - Main entry point for multi-pane rendering
- `execute_render_pass_with_borders()` - Render pass with border support
- `render_pane_borders()` - Placeholder for border rendering (logs viewports)

**Current behavior:** Renders only the focused pane's terminal content.

#### 5. **saternal-core/src/selection/renderer.rs**
Added viewport calculation:
- `PaneViewport` struct - Stores pane position, size, and focus state
- `calculate_pane_viewports()` - Public function to compute all viewports
- `calculate_viewports_recursive()` - Recursive tree traversal for layout

**Viewport Calculation:**
```rust
pub struct PaneViewport {
    pub pane_id: usize,
    pub x: u32,
    pub y: u32,
    pub width: u32,
    pub height: u32,
    pub focused: bool,
}

// Recursively calculates viewport rectangles with 2px borders
const BORDER_WIDTH: u32 = 2;
```

## How It Works

### Pane Tree Structure

The pane system uses a recursive tree structure:

```
PaneNode
├── Leaf { pane: Pane }              // Single terminal
└── Split {
      direction: Horizontal/Vertical,
      children: Vec<PaneNode>,
      ratio: f32 (0.0-1.0)            // Split ratio
    }
```

### Example Pane Layout

```
Initial:
┌─────────────────┐
│   Pane 0 (*)    │  (* = focused)
└─────────────────┘

After Ctrl+D:
┌─────────────────┐
│   Pane 0        │
├─────────────────┤
│   Pane 1 (*)    │
└─────────────────┘

After Ctrl+D again in Pane 1:
┌─────────────────┐
│   Pane 0        │
├─────────────────┤
│   Pane 1        │
├─────────────────┤
│   Pane 2 (*)    │
└─────────────────┘
```

### Focus Management Flow

1. **Split Operation:**
   - Find focused pane in tree
   - Replace it with Split node containing [old_pane, new_pane]
   - Clear focus from old pane
   - Set focus on new pane

2. **Navigation:**
   - Get flat list of all pane IDs
   - Find current focused pane index
   - Move to next/prev index (wrapping)
   - Update focus flags

3. **Close Operation:**
   - Find focused pane
   - Remove it from parent's children
   - Replace parent Split with remaining sibling
   - Focus first available pane

### Rendering Pipeline

Current implementation (MVP):
1. Calculate all pane viewports from tree
2. Render focused pane's terminal content (full screen)
3. Log viewport positions for debugging
4. **Future:** Render visible borders showing pane layout

## Technical Decisions

### Why Only Horizontal Splits?
Following **Elon's Step 1: Question Requirements** and **Step 2: Delete**:
- Start with minimum viable feature (horizontal only)
- Validate user workflow before adding complexity
- Vertical splits can be added incrementally if needed

### Why Circular Navigation?
Simple and predictable:
- No need for spatial awareness (up/down/left/right)
- Works with any pane layout
- Easy to implement and test

### Why 50/50 Split Ratio?
Follows **Step 3: Simplify**:
- Most common use case
- No UI needed for ratio adjustment
- Can add custom ratios later if requested

### Why Render Only Focused Pane?
Incremental implementation:
- MVP: Get core functionality working first
- Phase 2: Add simultaneous multi-pane rendering
- Avoids complexity of viewport clipping and multiple terminal renders

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Visual Borders**: Viewports calculated but not rendered (logs only)
2. **Single Pane Rendering**: Only focused pane visible (others exist but not shown)
3. **No Vertical Splits**: Only horizontal splits implemented
4. **Fixed 50/50 Ratio**: Cannot adjust split sizes
5. **No Mouse Support**: Keyboard-only navigation

### Planned Enhancements (Future)

#### Phase 2: Visual Polish
- [ ] Render pane borders using GPU shader
- [ ] Colored borders (blue=focused, gray=unfocused)
- [ ] Show all panes simultaneously (viewport clipping)

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Vertical splits (Ctrl+Shift+D)
- [ ] Adjustable split ratios (mouse drag or keyboard)
- [ ] Directional navigation (Ctrl+Alt+hjkl)
- [ ] Mouse click to focus pane

#### Phase 4: Power User Features
- [ ] Pane swap/reorder
- [ ] Save/restore pane layouts
- [ ] Named layouts (2-column, 3-row, etc.)
- [ ] Pane synchronization (send input to multiple panes)

## Testing

### Manual Test Cases

1. **Basic Split:**
   - Start terminal
   - Press Ctrl+D
   - Verify: 2 panes exist, bottom one focused
   - Type in bottom pane, verify input goes there

2. **Multiple Splits:**
   - Press Ctrl+D three times
   - Verify: 4 panes exist
   - Each pane runs independent shell

3. **Navigation:**
   - With 3+ panes open
   - Press Ctrl+Tab repeatedly
   - Verify: Focus cycles through all panes

4. **Close Pane:**
   - With 3 panes open
   - Press Ctrl+W
   - Verify: Focused pane closes, tree rebalances
   - Focus moves to next pane

5. **Cannot Close Last:**
   - With 1 pane remaining
   - Press Ctrl+W
   - Verify: Pane remains (log message: "Cannot close last pane")

6. **Window Resize:**
   - With multiple panes open
   - Resize terminal window
   - Verify: All panes resize proportionally

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Lines Added:** ~350 lines
- **Files Modified:** 7 files
- **New Public APIs:** 5 methods
- **Build Status:** ✅ Successful (warnings only, no errors)
- **Test Coverage:** Manual testing (automated tests TODO)

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None. This is a pure feature addition.

### API Changes
New public exports in `saternal-core`:
```rust
pub use pane::SplitDirection;
pub use selection::{PaneViewport, calculate_pane_viewports};
```

### Configuration Changes
None required. Feature works out of the box.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Ctrl+D doesn't split
- Check if shell is capturing Ctrl+D (EOF signal)
- Solution: Shell processes may intercept Ctrl+D if no input buffer

### Issue: Pane closes when pressing Ctrl+W
- Expected behavior - Ctrl+W closes focused pane
- To prevent accidental close, consider Ctrl+Shift+W instead

### Issue: Cannot see other panes
- Current limitation - only focused pane renders
- Viewports calculated but borders not yet drawn
- Future enhancement: simultaneous multi-pane rendering
