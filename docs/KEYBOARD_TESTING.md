# Test navigation:
# - Ctrl+A (should jump to start)
# - Ctrl+E (should jump to end)
# - Ctrl+B / Ctrl+F (should move char by char)
# - Ctrl+W (should delete "navigation")

ls -la
pwd
echo "test"

# Test history:

```

### Scenario 3: Process Control
```bash
# Start a long-running process
sleep 30

# Test interruption:
# - Ctrl+C (should cancel immediately)

# Start another process
sleep 30

# Test suspension:
# - Ctrl+Z (should suspend - shows [1]+ Stopped)
# - Type 'fg' to resume
```

### Scenario 4: Text Editing
```bash
# Start typing a command
echo "testing keyboard input"

## üìä Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- [x] Control characters (Ctrl+A through Ctrl+Z)
- [x] Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- [x] Modified arrow keys (Ctrl+Arrow, Shift+Arrow, Alt+Arrow)
- [x] Navigation keys (Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, Insert, Delete)
- [x] Function keys (F1-F12)
- [x] Special keys (Enter, Tab, Backspace, Escape)
- [x] Alt/Meta key combinations (ESC prefix)

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Notes

1. **Bracketed Paste**: The infrastructure is implemented but requires terminal initialization to enable `?2004h` mode
2. **Application Cursor Mode**: Currently using normal mode (ESC[A) not application mode (ESC OA)
3. **Some Ctrl combinations** might conflict with macOS system shortcuts

## üìù Testing Checklist

Use this checklist when testing the terminal:

### Basic Input
- [ ] Regular typing works (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, symbols)
- [ ] Enter executes commands
- [ ] Backspace deletes characters
- [ ] Tab autocompletes

### Navigation
- [ ] Arrow keys navigate cursor
- [ ] Home/End jump to line boundaries
- [ ] Ctrl+A / Ctrl+E jump to line boundaries

### Editing
- [ ] Ctrl+K kills to end of line
- [ ] Ctrl+U kills to start of line
- [ ] Ctrl+W kills word backward
- [ ] Ctrl+Y yanks killed text

### Process Control
- [ ] Ctrl+C interrupts running process
- [ ] Ctrl+Z suspends process
- [ ] Ctrl+D exits shell on empty line

### History
- [ ] Up/Down arrows navigate history
- [ ] Ctrl+R reverse searches history

### Editors
- [ ] Vim works (insert mode, navigation, commands)
- [ ] Nano works (all Ctrl commands)
- [ ] Less/More work (navigation, search, quit)
